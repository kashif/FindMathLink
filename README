This CMake module tries to find MathLink for Wolfram Mathematica application.

To run it we need to first say find_package(MathLink 7.0.1) which needs the Mathematica version, 7.0.1 in this case.

This then defines the following:
MathLink_Found
MathLink_INCLUDE_DIRS
MathLink_LIBRARY_DIRS
MathLink_LIBRARIES
as well as the following macro: MathLink_ADD_TM(addtwo.tm) which runs the mprep application on the template file addtwo.tm in this case to produce an addtwo.tm.c file. MathLink_ADD_TM also accepts a second optional argument e.g. MathLink_ADD_TM(addtwo.tm .cpp) to specify the extension of the output file.

This module is inspired by the initial version written by: Jan Woetzel and then Bart Janssen and Roel Jordans. The second optional argument feature is by Sascha Kratky.
